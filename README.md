# Holbertonschool-Hbnb Project

HBnB Evolution is a technical documentation project focused on designing the architecture of a simplified Airbnb-like application.  
The objective of this project is to define a clear system structure using a layered architecture approach before moving into the implementation phase.  
This documentation serves as a foundational blueprint that explains how different components of the system are organized and how they interact with each other.  
Emphasis is placed on UML modeling, clean architectural design, and separation of concerns.

## Package Diagram

This section presents the High-Level Package Diagram for the HBnB Evolution application.  
The diagram illustrates the overall system architecture based on a three-layer structure: Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Persistence Layer.  
It highlights how the layers interact with each other through the Facade Pattern, providing a clear separation of concerns and simplifying communication between components.  
This diagram offers a conceptual overview of the system without including implementation or database-specific details.

## Class Diagram

This section documents the class diagram for the Business Logic layer of the HBnB application.  
The diagram describes the core domain entities, their attributes, methods, and the relationships that govern their interactions.  
It focuses on modeling the fundamental business rules and behaviors independently of presentation or persistence concerns, ensuring a clean and maintainable design.

## Sequence Diagrams

This section presents the sequence diagrams for the HBnB Evolution application.  
These diagrams illustrate how the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Persistence Layer interact to handle key user operations.  
Each sequence diagram represents a specific API use case and demonstrates the flow of requests and responses across the system layers, highlighting how business logic is processed and how data is stored or retrieved.
